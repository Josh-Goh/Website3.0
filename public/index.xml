      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Introduction:  Though healthcare is primarily considers the biological underpinnings of disease, recent developments have shifted the field of healthcare towards a more holistic approach, considering all facets of an individuals life that may affect their health. One such factor is economic status, often represented as household income. Therefore, in this exploratory data analysis, two datasets from the health inequality project will be joined and analyzed. The first dataset focuses on life expectancy and household income, with variables that include Gender, Household Income Percentile, Year, Count, Mean Household Income, Race-Adjusted Life Expectancy, Unadjusted Life Expectancy, Standard Error of Race-Adjusted Life Expectancy, and Standard Error of Unadjusted Life Expectancy.</description>

      <description>Introduction:  One of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world today, heart disease is an umbrella term that covers all different types of specific cardiovascular disease such as strokes, heart attacks, arrhythmia, angina, coronary artery disease, and so on. From the raw Cleveland Heart Disease dataset there have been 1,025 observations on patients since 1988 describing information regarding 14 prediction attributable variables. After cleaning the dataset, omitting NAs, and dropping variables that were not clearly elucidated, the dataset is left with 944 observations with 11 variables: age (range from 29-77 years of age), sex (Male or Female), resting blood pressure (range from 94-192 mmHg), serum cholesterol (range from 126-564 mg/dL), fasting blood sugar (above or below 120 mg/dL), resting electrocardiographic results (normal, ST-T wave abnormality, or left ventricular hypertrophy), maximum attainable heart rate (71-202 bpm), exercise induced angina (yes or no), ST peak slope (flat, upsloping, or downsloping), thalassemia status (normal, fixed defect, or reversible defect), and heart disease diagnosis (‘1’ = Disease or ‘0’ = No Disease).</description>
